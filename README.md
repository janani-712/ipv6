# 🌐 IPv6 Transition and Implementation Model for Smart Institutions

## 📘 Overview
This project simulates how a smart institution (like a university) transitions from IPv4 to IPv6.  
It models devices and applies transition mechanisms like **Dual-Stack** and **Tunneling**.

## 🧠 Objective
- To demonstrate IPv6 adoption techniques in smart campus networks.
- To simulate real-world migration strategies using Python.

## ⚙️ Features
- Simulated IPv4 and IPv6 devices.
- Dual-stack transition modeling.
- IPv6 tunneling demonstration.
- Easy-to-understand Python implementation.

## 🔮 Future Scope

  -Integrate with real network simulation tools (like Cisco Packet Tracer).

  -Add GUI for visualization.

  -Simulate routing tables and latency.

## ⚙️ Setup and Initialization

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project on your system:

   🧩 Step 1: Prerequisites

      Make sure the following are installed on your computer:

         Python 3.8 or above

         VS Code or any Python IDE

         Git (to upload to GitHub)

         Check your Python version:

        python --version


    📁 Step 2: Create Project Folder

        Create a new folder for the project:

       mkdir ipv6_transition_model
       cd ipv6_transition_model


      Inside this folder, create the following files:

      main.py
      network.py
      transition_model.py
      requirements.txt
      README.md

  🧠 Step 3: Add Code

     Paste the provided code into each file:

     main.py – main execution file

     network.py – defines devices and network model

     transition_model.py – transition mechanisms (Dual-Stack, Tunneling, etc.)

     requirements.txt – list of dependencies (no external ones needed)

     README.md – documentation file

 ⚡ Step 4: Initialize the Project

    Open VS Code Terminal or Command Prompt, navigate to your project folder, and initialize Git:

     git init


   (Optional) create a new branch:

   git checkout -b main

 ▶️ Step 5: Run the Project

   Run the program using:

  python main.py

☁️ Step 6: Upload to GitHub

  Create a new repository in your GitHub account named
  ipv6-transition-model

  Connect your local project to GitHub:

  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit - IPv6 Transition Model Project"
  git branch -M main
  git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/ipv6-transition-model.gi
  git push -u origin main
